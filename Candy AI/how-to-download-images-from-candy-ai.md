## Step 4: Create Your Image
Here’s the fun part—making your image! On your dashboard, look for a button like **“Create”** or **“Generate Image.”** Click it. A box will pop up where you type what you want. Try something simple, like _“a cat wearing a hat.”_ Be clear so Candy AI knows what to draw.
After you type, hit the **“Generate”** button. Wait a few seconds—Candy AI is working hard! Soon, you’ll see your picture on the screen. If you don’t like it, tweak your words and try again. Maybe add _“a fluffy cat in a red hat”_ for more detail. Once you love your image, we’re ready to save it. This is where the real excitement builds!
## Step 5: Find the Download Button
You’ve made an awesome image—now let’s save it! Look at your picture on the screen. Under it or next to it, you’ll see a **“Download”** button. It might look like an arrow pointing down or just say “Download.” Found it? Great! That’s your key to keeping the image.
Sometimes the button hides a little, so check around the image carefully. If you still can’t see it, don’t panic—I’ve got tips later to help. For now, assume it’s there and ready. This button is like a magic wand—it grabs your picture and puts it on your device. Let’s click it in the next step!
## Step 6: Download Your Image
Time to save your masterpiece! Click that **“Download”** button you found. Your computer or phone will ask where to put the image. Pick a spot—like your “Pictures” folder—or just let it go to “Downloads.” Hit **“Save”** or **“OK,”** and watch it download. It’s fast, like grabbing a snack from the kitchen!
Once it’s done, go to that folder and check. There’s your image, safe and sound! It’s usually a file ending in _.jpg_ or _.png_—fancy names for picture files. Open it to make sure it looks good.

## Step 7: Troubleshoot Download Issues
What if downloading doesn’t work? Don’t worry—it happens sometimes. First, check your internet. Is it on and strong? Weak Wi-Fi can mess things up. Try refreshing the page by hitting the circle-arrow button in your browser. Then click “Download” again.
Still no luck? Look at the image size. Big pictures might take longer—give it a minute. If the button’s missing, log out and back in. That often fixes glitches. On a phone? Make sure you have space for more files. These tricks usually solve it. Now you’re ready to keep going smoothly!
## Step 8: Organize Your Downloaded Images
You’ve got your images—awesome! Now, keep them tidy. Make a folder on your computer or phone called _“Candy AI Pics.”_ Move your downloaded images there. It’s like putting toys in a box so you can find them later.
Name your files something fun, like _“DragonDay1.jpg”_ instead of boring numbers. This helps you remember what’s what. If you make lots of pictures, sort them by date or theme—like all your cat pics in one spot. Staying organized makes using your images way more fun. Let’s see what you can do with them next!
## Step 9: Use Your Images
Your images are saved—yay! Now what? Share them with friends on apps like WhatsApp or Instagram. They’ll love seeing your creations. You can print them for a poster or stick them in a notebook for school. How about making a comic with a bunch of Candy AI pictures? That’s super cool!

## Step 10: Tips for Easy Downloading
Want downloading to be a breeze? Here’s how! Use a good internet connection—faster Wi-Fi means quicker saves. Stick to simple images at first—big, detailed ones can slow things down. Always double-check where your file goes so you don’t lose it.
Got a phone? Download one image at a time to avoid mix-ups. On a computer, keep your browser updated—it helps everything run smooth. If Candy AI asks for a paid plan, try the free stuff first to practice. These tips make you a downloading pro. You’re almost a Candy AI expert now!
